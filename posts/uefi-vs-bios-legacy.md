"You will get an alert concerning the action you are taking and the fact that all data will be erased. For the partition type, select **GPT** if your BIOS is set to **UEFI** mode. For **Legacy boot**, select the '**msdos**' option. If you are satisfied with your selection click the '**Apply**' button."
